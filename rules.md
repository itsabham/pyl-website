# Server Rules


1) We expect all members of the community to follow Discord‚Äôs terms of service, including the age limitations. If you are under the age of 13, you should not be using this website! Terms of service violations will result in an instantaneous ban. If you are interested in reading the ToS for yourself, here is a link: https://discord.com/terms.

2) This server is meant to be an inclusive and welcoming environment for language learners from all over the world. Therefore, we prioritize the comfort of our community members. Any sort of suspicious behavior by a user that makes community members feel unsafe or uncomfortable, even in DMs, should be reported to the server staff team. The offender will then receive a mute or a ban upon their first infraction, depending on the severity of the behavior. A second infraction will result in a ban.

  We take harassment seriously. Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, or violent and/or threatening comments will not be tolerated. This includes using racial slurs, even as a ‚Äújoke.‚Äù Depending on the severity of the infraction, the first infraction will result in a mute or ban. Any further infraction will result in a definite ban.

3) Inappropriate language, including swearing, is allowed but should be kept to a minimum. However, excessive and prolonged swearing, especially if directed towards or at another member of the community, is grounds for a warning on the first infraction, and a mute on the second.
‚Äã
4) Self-Advertising on this server is prohibited, even through Direct Message, unless permission has been given prior. This includes sending other Discord server invites, streaming, social media, and YouTube channel links. However, permission can be given if a staff member is contacted. If a server member contacts you through DMs to advertise without permission, please report them to the staff. The first infraction will result in a warning, and further infraction will result in a ban.

5) Spamming and disruptive behavior is prohibited‚Äîthis includes sending the same or similar messages in a chat over and over again, general trolling, pinging community members repeatedly, and disruption of the current conversation topic in order to attract attention. This also include excessive use of CAPITAL LETTERS as a means of gaining attention. The first infraction is subject to a mute, and any further infractions are subject to a ban.

6) This is a SFW server, meaning that inappropriate, sexual, and offensive content is prohibited‚Äîeven if it is meant lightheartedly. Excessive sexual content is subject to a mute on the first infraction, and a ban on the second.

7) This is an international server, and thus we have people from all different cultures and backgrounds. Thus, we ask community members to be respectful and mindful of this. Rude and provocative comments based on someone‚Äôs culture, background, religion, or personal opinions will not be tolerated. The first infraction is grounds for a mute, and any further infraction will result in a ban.

8) This server is not subject to your definition of ‚Äúfairness.‚Äù Arguing with staff members will reduce the probability of having your punishment appealed. Please respect their decisions, as they are working hard to make this a safe and inclusive server for everyone!



# Voice Chat Rules



1) The general server rules apply to voice chats as well. If a person in a voice chat or speaking channel breaks one of the general server rules above, please open up a ticket and report them to the server staff.

2) Please aim to use the correct language for a language-specific voice channel (for example, English in the üîä‚îÉEnglish Practice 1) channel as much as possible. General voice channels do not have a set language, so if you intend on speaking in multiple languages, a general channel would be the best place to talk!

3) Please be polite to others in the voice call with you at all times. Try not to interrupt for speak over people who are practicing a new language, and make sure that everyone has the chance to be heard. Repeated and excessive interruption for the purpose of seeking attention is grounds for a VC Mute.

4) Do not make fun of people‚Äôs accents or the way they speak. Remember, many of us are new to our languages! This is considered rude behavior and is grounds for a VC Mute upon the first infraction.
‚Äã
5) Please refrain from saying things that could be taken as offensive. Try to make everyone in the call feel comfortable and included. Making offensive comments or comments that make other community members feel uncomfortable is grounds for a VC Mute.

6) Again, this server is not subject to your definition of ‚Äúfairness.‚Äù The staff have final say in all matters, and please respect their opinions!
